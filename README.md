# Minesweeper
This is my realisation of the popular game Minesweeper
Goal of the game is to open the whole field avoiding hidden mines
You can open a cell by using LEFT MOUSE BUTTON click
Opened cell can open nearby cells in case if there is no mines around or show how many mines around this cell in case if there any of them
If the cell you've clicked on contained mine then you will lose
You can place the flag to mark the cell where supposed mine is located by using RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON click
The main difference from classical variation of Minesweeper is the buttong Hint. When you click this button the game will briefly show you where is the mine around already opened cells(It will highlight the mine with yellow color)
If you successfully open the whole field you will WIN
If you click on the mine you will LOSE. You can restart the game by clicking button New game.
Good luck and have fun!
